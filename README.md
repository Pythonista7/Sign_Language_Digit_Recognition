# Sign_Language_Digit_Recognition
A simple CNN-classifier designed on keras to recognize Sign Language Digits. 

  Kindly download the Dataset from the link below.(Optional , all the image data has already been pre-processed,vectorized and stored in X_data.npy and y_data.npy

Another attempt as I was learning OpenCV is linker here do check it out: https://github.com/Pythonista7/OpenCV_selfTut/blob/master/SignLangDigitRecogWOpenCV.ipynb

  The following repository contains a jupyter notebook containing a detailed step-by-step instruction on how to build a image classifier in keras using a Convolutional Neural Net.

  A imgdatagen.py file has been provide if you want to know how the images were convertd into the form of training data used on the jupyter notebook.
